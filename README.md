Java framework Spring Boot and for Database used is PostgreSQL.
for frontend to display the task is React.js.

## Frontend used
The project utilizes the React library for developing web and native user interfaces. Axios is employed on the frontend for making HTTP requests, while CORS configuration in Spring Boot facilitates seamless integration between the frontend and backend components.
## Configure PostgreSQL

   1) Create a database in your PostgreSQL instance.
   2) Update the application.properties file in the src/main/resources folder with the URL, username and password for your PostgreSQL instance. The table schema for the Task Traker  will be created for you in the database.
      
## Build and run the sample

    1. mvnw package
    2. Open a web browser to http://localhost:3000 (Frontend integration).
    3. And on http://localhost:8309 (backend integration).

As you add and update tasks in the app you can verify the changes in the database through the PostgreSQL console.
